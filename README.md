# Mellis: Themelio's official GUI wallet

## How to install?

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/themeliolabs/mellis/releases) page to download the latest version. Currently, only the following platforms are supported:

- Windows (the `.exe` file)
- macOS (the `.dmg` file)
- Linux (Flatpak; the `.flatpak` file)

Once you're installed head over to our [discord](https://discord.gg/kNeBHn2B) to participate in our give-aways! 

## Initial Startup

When you first open Mellis you'll be presented a screen to either create a new wallet, or import a secret key

For now, let's create a new wallet and call it `test-wallet3`. 

Now that we have this new wallet, we need some coins to fill it. 

## Receiving Coins

First let's copy our wallet address. To do that, click the receive button and then click `copy`. 

You can now paste it a message to your `MEL`-rich friend and hope they give you some, or you can hop over to our [discord](https://discord.gg/kNeBHn2B) where we're happy to give `MEL` to our beta-testers 

## Sending Coins

Once you find yourself overflowing with `MEL` you might want to send it out. To do that click the send button, input the recipients address and the amount you want to send, then confirm this transaction in the next popup. Be aware that there are small transaction fees so the amount sent will be slightly more than what you input. 

Once you've confirmed the transaction, wait between 30 seconds and 1 minute and your recipient should automatically see those coins in their wallet.

## Viewing Transactions

If you'd like to see all transactions, including pending transactions, click the transactions tab. You can find it in the middle of the navigation bar on the bottom of the app window. From there you can see all transactions to and from your wallet. Notice that pending transactions appear with a progress spinner.

Tapping a transaction will result in a popup containing more information, and it will even include a link to our block explorer, [melscan](https://scan.themelio.org)

## Switching Wallets

Switching wallets is really simple. Just click the wallet name in the drop down at the top of the app window. 

From here you will see all available wallets, and you have the option to create a new wallet as well

## Tapping the Faucet

If you have a wallet on the test network, you have the ability to do what we call "tapping the faucet". That means you are allowed to print money! But don't get too excited. Because you can print a trillion `MEL` for free, it has no real monetary value. Still it's a great way to experiment with the network
 
## Settings


Right now there isn't much to do in the settings page. However, if you're interested you can access this page clicking the far right tab in the on screen navigation. Let us know if you can think of any features to add!
