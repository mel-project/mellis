There are 2 ways we can use this workflow

we can 1: specify a release notes by file
or 2: create a draft, work on body, then release

if we want the workflow to include a draft release
we can also use a file to specify the body


the real benefit of creating a draft release is giving us the option
to inspect the release before it goes out
