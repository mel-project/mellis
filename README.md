# Mellis: Themelio's official GUI wallet

## How to install?

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/themeliolabs/mellis/releases) page to download the latest version. Currently, only the following platforms are supported:

- Windows (the `.exe` file)
- macOS (the `.dmg` file)
- Linux (Flatpak; the `.flatpak` file)

Once you're installed head over to our [discord](https://discord.gg/kNeBHn2B) to participate in our give-aways! 

## Initial Startup

When you first open Mellis you'll be presented a screen to either create a new wallet, or import a secret key

For now, let's create a new wallet and call it,`test-wallet3`. 

Now that we have this new wallet, we need some coins to fill it. 

## Receiving Coins

First let's copy our wallet address. To do that, click receive button and then click `copy`. 

You can now paste it a message to your `MEL`-rich friend and hope they give you some, or you can hop over to our discord where we're happy to give our beta-testers `MEL`

## Sending Coins

Once you find yourself overflowing with `MEL` you might want to send it out. To do that click the send button, input the recipients address and the amount you want to send, then confirm this transaction in the next popup. Be aware that there are small transaction fees so the amount you send will be slightly more than what you requested. 

Once you've confirmed the transaction, wait between 30 seconds and 1 minute and your recipient should automatically see those coins in their wallet.

## Viewing Transactions

If you'd like to see all transactions, including pending transactions, click on the middle, transactions, tab on the bottom of the screen. From there you can see all confirmed transactions to and from your wallet. Notice that pending transactions appear with a progress spinner.

Tapping a transaction will result in a popup containing more information, and it will even include a link to our block explorer, [melscan](https://scan.themelio.org)

As of right now we are getting everything ready for our token sale, but you can still receive real `MEL`, our stable-coin, into your new wallet.
